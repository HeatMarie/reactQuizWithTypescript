# reactQuizWithTypescript
Oh, you know, just playing with things. I might have created a quiz before, but let us see what magic we can work with a little  React and Typescript.

This app was created using the following video:

Here's the deal, we all got to start somewhere. This is my first time using Typescript and some of the best ways to learn is by following hands on tutorials. All thanks goes to freeCodeCamp.org for this lesson! Thank you!.

## Comments 

One thing I love about following along with videos is that you get to learn different ways of doing something you have done before. Utilizing Typescript seemed to make things easier to follow. Perhaps that is from my previous experience working with JS and the way that knowledge kicks back in reminding me that I have no forgotten everything. 

Completing walk-through videos is a sure way to kick confidence into gear and calm the imposter syndrome. So let's see what more fun things we can accomplish, shall we?
